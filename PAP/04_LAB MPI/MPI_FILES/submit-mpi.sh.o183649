Heat execution with 1 nodes and 4 total processes (4 processes per node)
I am the master running on boada-7, distributing work to 3 additional workers ...
I am worker 2 on boada-7 and ready to receive work from master ...
I am worker 1 on boada-7 and ready to receive work from master ...
I am worker 3 on boada-7 and ready to receive work from master ...

The chunks have 17028 elements
Worker 1: have 258 columns and 66 rows
Worker 1 recive the[17028]
Worker 2: have 258 columns and 66 rows
	====>Between proces, send the 16770 column
Worker 2 recive the[34056]
Worker 3: have 258 columns and 66 rows
	====>Between proces, send the 16770 column
Worker 3 recive the[51084]
	===> Master notify proc 1 the 16770 row
	====>Between proces, send the 16770 column
Master end his loop.
